She has 5 years of project management and design experience in the green building industry. More recently, she has dedicated her time and interests locally, engaging with communities as they develop plans for change. Currently,\u00a0Evaine\u00a0works at Growth Through Energy & Community Health [GTECH] as the Director of Operations and Programming. GTECH is a non-profit that works to help communities take ownership of the challenges of growth and decline and turn them into opportunities to build capacity, make things happen and strengthen their community. \nEmily Voelker is a graduate of the University of Maryland\u2019s Geographical Sciences department, with a focus on environmental science, GIS, and geospatial analysis. Previously, Emily worked at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, where she supported the NASA DEVELOP geospatial program and led applied research projects. She is currently an apprentice at the Pittsburgh Botanic Garden through AmeriCorps Public Allies, where she focuses on community development, social justice, and environmental education. \n FAQs\u00a0 \nWhat does it cost? \u00a0The course runs $499. Pay half now ($249) to reserve your spot and we will bill you for the second half later on. \nWhen are courses held? \nClasses are held every Thursday from 7:00 - 9:15 pm at the GTECH offices. The course runs for 10 weeks from March 26th to May 28th. \nIs there an age limit to sign up for this course? \nGenerally, students should be 18+, but mature and interested students 14+ are welcome. \nDo I need to buy any additional materials or software? \n- All students are required to purchase the book/software package: \"GIS Tutorial 1\" by Kurland and Gorr. Be sure to purchase the NEW version, as it comes with a 6-month trial of the software you will need for the course. \n- All students should plan to provide their own\u00a0Laptop\u00a0and ArcGIS\u00a0software\u00a0for the course. This software only working in the Windows Operating System, if you have a Mac, you can run a Windows virtual machine through your Mac or try and borrow a PC. \nIf I don't own a laptop, can I borrow one? \nAdditionally, we have 1 student laptop available free of charge based on need (a Macbook Pro with Windows 8 and ArcGIS installed). Just ask us if you need to borrow it for part or all of the course!\u00a0We will also have 3-4 desktops on location (with ArcGIS installed) for students who cannot provide their own computer. \nWhere does the money go? \nOpen cost analysis: - Instructor wages: 64% - Administrative and Marketing costs: 23% - Classroom costs (contribution to GTECH): 8% - Learning supplies: 6% \n(Open Cost publishing is a new effort in transparency by the Saxifrage School to ensure students know what their money is being spent on when they sign up for courses. The \u201cTuition\u201d moniker implies that funds are spent on instruction, but this is increasingly not the case at many schools. We want to change that.) \n  ",
