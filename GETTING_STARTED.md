# City as a Campus - Getting Started

##### Objective

City as a Campus (CaaC) is an open-source platform<sup>0</sup> for creating connected learning communities. The platform contains sets of tools for learners, organizers, and community anchors<sup>1</sup>.

##### Operations

As a result of the City as a Campus platform's open source nature, each city anchor should <a href="https://github.com/saxifrage/learn">fork the main platform</a> to operate however they feel is best. However, each city anchor should set up an "Advisory Panel" of about 5 people<sup>2</sup> that review and curate learning opportunities. The processes shouldn't be extremely formal, but we (the volunteers at City as a Campus) think there are some fundamental practices that should be recognized to ensure success.

##### Curation

The Anchor Advisory Panel should consistently search for possible learning opportunities to add to their platform. One workflow is to:
- Email/Tweet the organizers of existing local learning opportunities a link to our platform to enter their opportunity to ensure successfor review
- Email qualified organizations that would possibly sponsor new learning opportunities with a description of the platform and how sponsoring would be mutually beneficial. Include a phone number to a volunteer from the Anchor Advisory Panel

Using the Admin Portal, the Anchor Advisory Panel should review each new learning opportunity before making it public. One workflow is to:
- Ensure the learning opportunity doesn't already exist
- Ensure the learning opportunity data is valid (date/time, description, logo, name, location, sponsoring organization, etc)
- Perform a one-time, informal credibility check on the instructor (Google search them to ensure there are no obvious "red flags" and review their background in this field)

<sup>0</sup> Currently in development phase right now, however.

<sup>1</sup> "Anchors" are organizations that set up and host their copy of the City as a Campus platform. For example, The Sprout Fund is the "Anchor" for <a href="http://learnpgh.org/">Pittsburgh</a>, which is using the CaaC platform.

<sup>2</sup> This number may grow as certain local experts/organizers will naturally "partner"/regulary help.
